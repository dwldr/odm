<p>More than 3 million of us share Oregonâ€™s streets and highways. We ask that you always drive safely and courteously. Remember, driving is a privilege you earn, not a right. Be careful to drive in a way that allows you to keep that privilege. While driving a motor vehicle on highways or premises open to the public in Oregon, you must have either a valid driver license or instruction permit in your possession.</p>

    <h2>Oregon Resident</h2>
    <p>You must get an Oregon driving privilege when you become a resident, even if your out-of-state license or permit has not expired. When DMV issues an Oregon driving privilege, you must turn in any license or permit you have from another state or country. If your Oregon driving privileges are suspended or revoked, you cannot drive in Oregon with a license or permit from another state.</p>

    <h2>Resident of a Different State</h2>
    <p>Residents of other states who drive vehicles in Oregon must be at least 16 years of age and have a valid out-of-state license or be at least 15 years of age and have a valid out-of-state permit. Out-of-state permit holders must abide by the same restrictions as persons with an Oregon permit. If you are in the military on active duty, you do not need an Oregon license if you have a valid license from your home state. A spouse of someone in military service may also drive in Oregon with a valid license from another state.</p>
